# Kubernetes CloudFormation
This project is a series of [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates that will deploy a [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io) into an [Amazon Web Services VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/).  The templates are designed to be deployed through a [CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) that is triggered by changes to a [Git](https://git-scm.com) repository.

The project is heavily influenced by [Kelsey Hightower's](https://github.com/kelseyhightower) excellent ["Kubernetes the Hard Way"](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).  One day I'll write a [blog](https://keithmsharp.wordpress.com) describing in detail how this works.
